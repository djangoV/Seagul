This is a new project, where I learn and revise the basics of Git and Git Hub. I will practice the Git commands extensively here.

I am going to start with creating this file in a local computer. I will initilize this folder that contains this file as a gt repositary in my local computer. I will upload this local repository to my github remote location to make it as a remote repository.
